# Exercise 2: Make

Make is an automation tool, that is often used to improve the build process. 
This exercise serves as a mild refresher to Make and sets the precendence for the upcoming exercises in Bibtake.

Yocto uses Make as part of its build system, to automate the creation of embedded linux distributions.


# Todo : Refine this para more
Make is integral in Yocto’s BitBake tool, which processes recipes and layers to build software packages. It helps manage dependencies, compile code, and execute tasks like installation and packaging. Make's efficiency in handling complex workflows complements Yocto’s modular and flexible approach to embedded systems. Together, they streamline the build process for customized Linux distributions targeting embedded devices.

# Todo : Add some more indepth information on Make.

## Objective:
- Fix the Makefile, so that we can build some linux kernel modules.

## Principles Covered
-  Syntax

### Files
* `yocto_driver.c` and `build.sh` 





## Duration : 10-15 mins.
