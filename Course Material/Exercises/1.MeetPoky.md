# Exercise 1 : Meet Poky 

## Learning Outcome 

-  Meet poky
-  Learn commands to build an image.
-  Run an image.

## Meet Poky

- [Poky](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/overview-manual/yp-intro.html#reference-distribution-poky) is the **reference distribution** of the Yocto Project which uses OpenEmbedded build system Technology. 

- In this Virtual Machine(VM), Poky is available at `~/git/poky`.
- Start by `cd ~/git/poky`.
  
## Part 1 : Getting Started

### oe-init-build-env script
1.  Read through the content of  the script `oe-init-build-env`.
- Identify how this script is called.
- What type of license applies to this script?

   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
    Just try to read the first few lines of this script. It's a complex script, don't let it bother you. 
</details>

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   This script is to be called  `./oe-init-build-env builddir` and the license is `GPL-2.0`
   </details>

2. What happens when you source this file? 
   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
    What does the name indicate? 
</details>
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   The sourcing creates the build environment, the configuration files and switches us to the build directory.
   </details>

   3. Once sourced, the script provides images that start with `core-image`. Take a note of them.
   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
     pay special attention to the names  core-image-* 
</details>
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
 - we  see the images : `core-image-minimal`, `core-image-full-cmdline`, `core-image-weston` and so on when we source the script.
   </details>

3. We are now inside the build directory, apart from creating the build directory, several configuration files (confs) have been created. 
Can you find the conf file with the largest code length?
   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
    - You can use `find . -name "*.conf"` to find all the conf files inside a specific directory
    - Use `wc` to find word count for the files
    - **Pro tip**: use `xargs` if possible to combine find and wc.
</details>
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
    `local.conf` is the file
   </details>

## Part 2: Conf files

 Choose the one with the largest lines and try to read through the comments. The file is very often used and is very well documented, don't let it overwhelm you.

4. Can you identify what Distribution `DISTRO`  it is using? 
5. and what is the architecture of  the `MACHINE`  that is being built?
   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
    - Check the DISTRO Variable and see what it is set for distribution
    - Look at the `MACHINE` variable maybe there is a clue to what architecture we are building.
</details>
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
    - Distribution can be found from the `DISTRO` variable which is set to "poky"
    - The architecture being built can be found from the `MACHINE` variable which is set to `qemux86-64`
   </details>

6. Identify if  GDB, a debugging tool is supported in this build?
   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
    - Reading the comments above EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES could give you an idea.
</details>
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
  - Debugging tools are not enabled. `tools-debug` add support for gdb and other debugging tools.
   </details>

## Part 3: Build an image 
 
 Bitbake our build system is part of the yocto project and is used to build images. 
 We can now start building a simple image and see what happens.

7. Build the `core-image-minimal` image using the information obtained earlier.

   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
    -**Bitbake** our build system, can build an image just like this `bitbake  Image_name`. 
   </details>
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
  - `bitbake core-image-minimal`
   </details>
   
8. Build another variant of the image, `bitbake core-image-full-cmdline`

- Several build tasks are started by this process.
- Details of which will be covered later in the course.

9. The built root file system has a format `.ext4` and it can be found in the build director, can you find it?

  <details>
    <summary>hint</summary>
    You can use `find . -name "core-image*.ext4"` to find the file, from which you can infer the directory.
    </details>
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
  - You can find the output images here `/home/yocto/work/poky/poky/build/tmp/deploy/images/qemux86-64`
   </details>
   

## Part 4: Running an Image

- The images have been built, now we can compare both the images.
- In order to compare it is recommended to split the terminal window.
- This can be done by right clicking and splitting the window.
- An image can be run using the runqemu command.

10. On the left window, try to run the `core-image-minimal` and on the right window run `core-image-full-cmdline`.
   
what command can we use?
   <details>
    <summary>hint</summary>
    `runqemu image_name`
    </details>
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
  -  Use `runqemu core-image-minimal`  on the left
  -  Use `runqemu core-image-full-cmdline` on the right
   </details>

### login

* Use root as password for login.

## Part 5 : Compare the Images

**Congratulations**, now you have both the images running. 
Now its time to note the difference between them.

11. Identify the applications installed inside the core-image-minimal image?
   <details>
    <summary>hint</summary>
    You can check the installed applications under `bin` directory
    </details>
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
  - `ls /usr/bin`
   </details>
   
12. Identify the applications installed inside the core-image-full-cmd-line image?
   <details>
    <summary>hint</summary>
    You can check the installed applications under `bin` directory
    </details>
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
  - `ls /usr/bin`
   </details>


 Can you find any common programs in both?


## Part 6 : QEMU hardware 
  
13. Quick Emulator (QEMU) helps emulate a hardware. Currently the default settings are applied.
    Can you identify 
    - How much free memory is available?
    - How many processor cores are present in the image built?
    
    <details>
    <summary>hint</summary>
    - Use the command `free` to find the memory
    - Use the command `nproc` to find the processors
    </details>

## Part 7 Exiting the QEMU

14. use `CTRL + A+ X` to exit qemu*
