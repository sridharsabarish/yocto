# Exericse : Bitbake #minoreview 

## Learning outcomes #refined 

- Understanding the difference with Make
-  Getting comfortable with Bitbake Syntax.
## Introduction
- Understanding BitBake variable syntax is crucial for configuring and controlling the build process in the Yocto Project.
- Bitbake syntax is similar to Make, however there are some nuances.
## Part 1 : Getting Started #refined 

1. A very simple assignment.
```bash
 A = "Hej \
      Hola \
      Salut \
      "
```
    
 **Question:**  If i print *A*, how many lines would it contain?

   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
   What does the "` \ "` operator really mean? 
</details>

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   Its just one line, \ just treats the text as if they are next to each other.
   </details>







    
1.  Expanding Variables  
```shell

    B = "Yocto"

    C = "Embedded"

    D = "{B}{C}"

    B = "Open"

    E = "D{C}"

  
```

   Question: What is the value of **D & E?**

   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
	- Is the value of B Assigned in line 1 or line 4?
	- Are you paying attention to the braces.
  
</details>

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
	- B will be assigned to Open in line 4, so D will use that value and is expanded to "OpenEmbedded"
	- With *E* the trick is to pay attention, the *D* doesn't have curly braces, so it is not expanded. The output would be DEmbedded.
   </details>





1. Default Values (?=)
```shell

    CANDY? ="Licorice"

    FIKA = "Kanelbulle"

    CANDY = "M&M"

    DRINK ?= "COFFEE"

    DRINK ?= "TEA"

    FIKA ?= "Pan au chocolat"
```
   
   **Question:**  I would drink _ with my _ while munching _

   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
   When is a default value assigned?
</details>

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   A default value is assigned when it is empty.
   CANDY is assigned a value `"M&M"`
  DRINK takes on the first value which is "COFFEE"
  FIKA is of course "Kanelbulle"
  
   </details>





1. Weak defaults (??=)

   .
```shell

    SUMMER??="JULY"

    WINTER="DECEMBER"

    VACATION??="MARCH"

    SUMMER??="AUGUST"

    WINTER??="FEBRUARY"
```
  **Question :** When is SUMMER and WINTER?


   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
    Note: This expands immediately when empty and also replaces previous  weak defaults values
</details>

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   - Weak defaults can replace previous default, so `SUMMER` is now 'AUGUST'
   - WINTER is set as DECEMBER initially and stay the same.
   - VACATION is ofcourse MARCH.
  
   </details>


## Part 2: Expansions  and Appends #refined 
1. Immediate expansion and Appends
```shell
    C = "Summery"
    A :="Hello ${C}"
    C = "Wintery"
    A +="Sweden"
    B ="Hello"
    B .="OpenEmbedded"
```
   **Question:** What is the value of A and B?
   
   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
   Are all appends same? Are all assignment same?
</details>

  <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
	   - A is initially assigned the value Hello Summery
	   - Then "Sweden" is appended to A with a space so A become "Hello Summery Sweden"
	   - B is initially assigned Hello and is appended without spaces, so it become "HelloOpenEmbedded"
   </details>

1. Overrides Style Syntax (append and prepend)
```shell

    MACHINE = "intel"

    MACHINE:append = "amd"

    MACHINE2 ="amd"

    MACHINE2:prepend ="intel "

    MACHINE3 ="intel amd"

    MACHINE4 ="intelamd"

    MACHINE5 = "intel amd "

  
```

  **Question** : Which machines are the same?


   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
    How does override syntax work? 
</details>

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
 - MACHINE and MACHINE 4 are the same
 - MACHINE 2 and MACHINE 3 are the same 
  
   </details>




1. Removal
```bash
    HERO = "Romeo"
    AUTHOR = "Shakespeare"
    AUTHOR:prepend = "William-"
    REMOVE_HERO ="Macbeth Othello"
    HERO +="Antonio"
    HERO +="Balthasar"
    HERO +="Othello"
    HERO +="Macbeth"
    HERO:remove = "$REMOVE_HERO"
    REMOVE_HERO ="Macbeth Balthasar"
```
    
   Question: What is the name of the Author and who are the heros?

   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
    is remove immediate or does it wait for the variable to be set?
</details>

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
	- the variable is set to the last value macbeth balthasar and these are removed from hereos.
	 - AUTHOR Is ofcourse "William-Shakespeare"
   </details>



1. Override vs normal

  **Consider a BBCLASS, a class.**

```bash
    //FRUIT.bbclass
    FRUIT1 +="TOMATO"
    FRUIT2:append = " TOMATO"
```
Actual code

```bash
    inherit FRUIT
    FRUIT1 = "Durian"
    FRUIT2 = "Durian" 
```
**Are fruit 1 and fruit 2 same?**

   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
    Override syntax guarantees an operation
</details>

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
	- No They are not 
	- FRUIT1 is set to DURIAN
	- FRUIT2 is set to Durian TOMATO
   </details>





## Part 3: Conditional Metadata
1. Overrides

```shell
 OVERRIDES="fruit:french:food"
 HELLO = "How are you doing?"
 HELLO:french ="Comment ça va?"
 B="HELLO"
 C="${HELLO}"
```



 **Question:** What is the value of B and C?


   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
    How does OVERRIDES affect metadata?
</details>


   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
	   -  When OVERRIDES variable is set, it changes the metadata. So now HELLO is overriden to HELLO:french , so the value of C is "Comment Ca va?"
	   - B is HELLO
   </details>



1. Overrides with appends

```shell
OVERRIDES="qemu:qemux86-64:arm:qemux86"
SUPPORTED_MACHINES ="intel"
UNSUPPORTED_MACHINES="amd"
SUPPORTED_MACHINES:append:qemux86 ="qemux86"
UNSUPPORTED_MACHINES:append:intel="intel"
```
   
   **Question:** What is the value of `SUPPORTED_MACHINES` and `UNSUPPORTED_MACHINES`?



   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
   Are all the overrides set?
</details>

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
	   -  SUPPORTED machines will be "intelqemux86" 
	   - UNSUPPORTED machines will be amd because the override "intel" is not set in the OVERRIDES variable!
  
   </details>


1. Appends and prepends

  ```sh
    DEPENDS ="vim gcc python"
    OVERRIDES ="vscode:powerpoint:paint"
    DEPENDS:append:vscode =" .NET3.5"
    DEPEMDS:prepend:vscode =".NET Core "
```
   
  **Question :** What is the value of `DEPENDS` if we use the override VSCODE?



   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
    Are you paying attention?
</details>

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   -  DEPENDS is just appended, prepend is a farce.
   -  So the output would be "vim gcc python .NET3.5"
  
   </details>






1. Multiple overrides

    ```sh
    DEPENDS = "vim bash nano"
    DEPENDS:vscode= ".net-core bash"
    DEPENDS:powerpoint=".net-core"
    DEPENDS:pages="swift xcode"
    DEPENDS:virutalbox="windows"

    ```

  
    **What would be the value of DEPENDS?**

    1. If override is set?

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
- Depends on the OVERRIDES Variable.  
   </details>

    1. If override is not set?

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   - It would be "vim bash nano"
   </details>

 
## Part 4 : Cracking the Code #minoreview 
Okay, now that you are familiar with Bitbake syntax, there is one final puzzle.
```bash
OVERRIDES= ":germen:"
SUMMARY = "Mystery Package"
DESCRIPTION = "A mysterious package"
LICENSE = "MIT"
DECRYPT_LOGIC="Shift right by 1"
INITIAL_CODE:= "GDKKN"
SRC_URI ?= "https://github.com/sridharsabarish/yocto/blob/main/General%20Resources/quiz.md"
SRC_URI ??= "https://github.com/sridharsabarish/yocto/blob/main/General%20Resources/cheatsheet2.md"
SRC_URI = "https://github.com/sridharsabarish/yocto/blob/main/General%20Resources/cheatsheet.md"
SUMMARY .= "s"
DESCRIPTION +="that could change the "
WORLD ="WORLD"
WORLD:german ="WELT"
DESCRIPTION .="${WORLD}"
CRACKED_CODE ="$(WORLD)"
INITIAL_CODE+= "VNQKC"
CRACKED_CODE:prepend="HELLO "
```

  **Questions:**
* What is the value of SRC_URI?

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
	-  Assignment trumps all the defaults
	- It is set 
	SRC_URI ="https://github.com/sridharsabarish/yocto/blob/main/General%20Resources/cheatsheet.md"
  
   </details>


* What is the DESCRIPTION?

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
	-  Description is initially set to "A mysterious package", then the words are added with space and then the value of $WORLD is added without space
		- This makes it "A mysterious package that could change the WORLD" as "german" is not set in the OVERRIDES variable!
  
   </details>




* Is cracked_Code the cesar's cipher of the initial code?

   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
	-  Yes!
	- CRacked code is "HELLO WORLD"
	- Initial Code is "GDKKN VNQKC"
	- Add one to all characters and you get the cracked code!
  
   </details>
