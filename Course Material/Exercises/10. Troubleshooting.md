## Tips #tips #TOBEREMOVED

- [ ] Take a working recipe bitbake it and now deliberately make some errors and ask the students to fix it.

## Part 1: Adding Logs to Recipes #minoreview 

1. [ ] Create the recipe #todo 
1. Add bberror, bbfatal, bbwarn, bbnote,bbplain, bbdebug to different tasks in a recipe
2. Build with and without verbose flag.
3. EXPLORE The logs from bitbake from a specific folder 
	### Explore log files
	Â ``log.do_<>.pid``



## Part 2: Debugging Metadata #minoreview 
1. [ ] Use the same recipe and just have a lot of variables, makesure they chagne in diffeent places #todo 
1. Use  bitbake -e to identify what is the value of three different variables`bitbake -e core-image-minimal | grep "^S="`



 
## Part 3: Dependency Graph #minoreview 

- Something about visualizing it in graphviz and seeing it for ourselves.
1. `bitbake -g -u taskexp_ncurses <recipe_name>`
1. Check dependecy for two other recipe

## Part 4 : Actually troubleshooting!


## Part 5: Add Support for GDB #majorreview 
* Do this in the local.conf
* Read it and find the command that adds gdb
* [ ] give hints
