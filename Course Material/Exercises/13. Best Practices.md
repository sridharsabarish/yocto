# Exercise 9: Best Practices
## Learning Outcome 

* Lean how to identify what licenses are being used by what recipe.
* Learn how to satisfy Copy-left /GPLv3 Compliance
* Best practices such as 
	* Creating a custom Distro
	* Enabling build-info
	* Using Extended SDK
	* Reducing the number of layers.

## Part 1: Licensing

* Being aware of licensing is crucial to avoid any potential copyright issues when we develop software.
1. Poky builds the license manifest in a specific folder, identify this folder ?

   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
   It is the tmp folder.
</details>
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	`~/work/poky/poky/build/tmp/deploy/license` contains licensing information for all the packages!
   </details>

2. If lets say i want to use a recipe to my commercial build which of the following license should i be careful about? `GPL-2.0-only, GPL-3.0-or-later, MIT, Apache-2.0`
   <details>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
`GPL-2.0-only` and GPL-3.0 or later` are dangerous
</details>

3. If i am creating a new recipe and i want to give a different license to it. Where can i find the md5sum for the license that is needed by the `LIC_FILE_CHKSUM` metadata?

   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
   check the `meta` layer
</details>
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	- /home/yocto/work/poky/poky/meta/files/common-licenses
	- and then we can run md5sum
   </details>

### Compliance Check

* Go to `meta-exercises/recipes-licensing/`. 
* There is a script `findLicenses.sh` which identifies licenses included in the package output. 
* The script takes one argument as input which is the license type.

4. Use this script, to find the recipes which have `MIT` license.

  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	- ./findLicenses MIT
	
   </details>

5. How about the packages that are potentially problematic  such as `GPL-3.0`or `LGPL` for commercial use?
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	-  `./findLicenses GPL-3.0`
   </details>


## Part 2: CopyLeft Compliance

Copy left project have the following obligation 
- The source code of the project
- The license for the project
- Any modification to the project
- Any script that is required to configure and build

6. How can we provide the source code for the project? 

   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
   we inherit something
</details>
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
    -  `INHERIT += "archiver"`
    - `ARCHIVER_MODE[src] = "original"`
   </details>
7. How can we provide the source modifications?

  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
    - `ARCHIVER_MODE[src] = "patched"`
   </details>

8. How can we provide the licensing text?
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
    - `COPY_LIC_MANIFEST = "1"`
    - 'COPY_LIC_DIRS = "1"'`
   </details>

## Part 3 :  Best Practices

9. Until now, we have been violating a best practice that has been so obvious. This is a violation that makes us loose all our data if there is an update to our code. What can we do to mitigate this mistake?
   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
   Is all our metadata version controlled?
</details>
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	- Local.conf is not version controlled, so we should remove the changes from local.conf and instead move it our custom layer and recipes instead!
   </details>

10. Poky is a good source of reference, can we just use poky to build our images?

   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
   Look at the Learning outcome
</details>
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	We have to transition to a custom distro and we cannot use poky as it has a lot of unnecessary packages.
   </details>

11. Poky gave us two of the best practices for free and we didn't even have to look for them. One was the `buildinfo` and the other `bill of materials`, how can we enable them in our `custom distro`?
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	INHERIT += "create-spdx"
	`inherit image-buildinfo`
	
   </details>
