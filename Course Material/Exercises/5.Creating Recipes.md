# Exercise: Create a recipe that would break heads.

Todo : Reuse exisiting Recipe! #tip 

- [ ] Find a recipe to use as a base #todo 

 Idea: We are gonna release a tool, which will have two version, both the version should source the bbclass, only the version number will be changed in the respective bb files #tip

## Learning Outcome
* Learn different ways of creating a recipe.
* Learn how to add a task to a recipe that performs a certain action
* Learn how to create a bitbake class
* Learn the difference between an `inc` and `bbclass`

## Part 1 : Creating a recipe
* create a recipe initially
* Then refactor into classes
* Includes
### Create a recipe manually

1. Go to the folder meta-experiements.
2. Create a folder called firstRecipe and create a firstRecipe.bb
3. There is an existing base recipe called start.bb use the content from this recipe and copy this here.
4. Add two tasks do_compile and do_install, which would install a c file and a shell script inside our Image.
5. These takss should be moved ot a class later and reuseud.


 Give them the file :


```cpp

something 
to be filled.


```







7. Create a recipe using recipestool
8. create a recipe using devtool
9. Create a recipe called `hello` using recipestool
10. Build the recipe
11. Adding tasks to the recipe  

## Part 3: Create a class

  

1. move these tasks to the class
2. Add couple more metadata here 

  

## Part 2 : Add  extra task to the class created

1. Add a task called do_fetch()

1. Add a task called do_install()

1. Add a task called do_make_dir

  
  

## Part 4: Inherit this class in the created recipe #todo #majorreview 

  
  
  
  

## Part 5: Create incl files #todo #majorreview 

  Move the METADATA to include files for reusability.

## Part 6: Show the tree and see how refactoring improves.

  

Recipe 2

  
  

## Inherit this file



- [ ] Give answer in the end as a git link or file #todo
