# Exercise 11: BSP & Kernel Modifications!

## Learning Outcome

1. Explore the existing BSP layers in Yocto
2. Learn how to find more BSPs!
3. Learn how to modify the linux kernel 
##  Part 1 : Introduction

A **Board Support Package** (BSP) is a collection of information that defines how to support a particular hardware device, set of devices, or hardware platform. We can create a layer to keep recipes and other metadata related to this information. Usually this is done by the Vendor of a board and we can ususally find the Board support here https://layers.openembedded.org/

In the image below we see the source for these layers and it is just  a matter of cloning these layers and adding to our yocto build.

1. If i want to include support for `NVIDIA Tegra` processors which layer should i be downloading?

   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
   type nvidia tegra in the search with layers
</details>
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	`meta-tegra` is the needed layer! 
   </details>
## Part 2  : Exploring existing BSP layers
2. In our yocto build, we have used the `meta-yocto-bsp` layer from this layer can you find out what machines are already supported by us?
   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
   Maybe the directory structure of `conf` can give a hint?
</details>
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	   `beaglebone-yocto`, `genericarm64`. `genericx86-64` and `genericx86`
   </details>

3. But wait, aren't we using `qemux86-64` for our builds, where does that come from? 

   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
   Are there only one bsp layers?
</details>
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	check `home/yocto/work/poky/poky/meta/conf/machine`
   </details>

## Part 2: Machines 
4. Once we have the layers in place with the conf for each machine, how do we build for the machine? Maybe the `local.conf` has some clue?
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	`MACHINE` variable needs to be set
   </details>

5. If i have beagle-bone board and i want to build for this machine, what should i set the metadata to?
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	 `MACHINE="beaglebone-yocto"`
   </details>

6. There are a lots of variables that can be used for configuring the machine specific metadata, which of the following is not a machine variable? `SERIAL_CONSOLES` , `KERNEL_IMAGETYPE` , `MACHINEOVERRIDES`, `TUNE_ARCH`, `MACHINE_FEATURES`, `MACHINE_INSTALLS`, `PREFERRED_PROVIDER`

  <details>
	   <summary>Hint</summary>
	When in doubt check!
	https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html
   </details>

  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	 `MACHINE_INSTALLS`
   </details>



## Part 3: Kernel development 101 - Use Config fragments for updating Kernel. 

In this segment, we will cover minor details on how to modify the kernel using kernel fragments.
You can refer to the [kernel manual for help](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/kernel-dev/index.html) 

7. Run this command

```shell
bitbake virtual/kernel -c menuconfig
```

8.  Go to  `Networking Support`  and enable the `CAN bus subsystem support`
Feel free to enable more setting as you like.

Now go the exit option and keep exiting.
At the end it will ask you to save like the image below, choose the yes option

9. Exit the menu config

10. Run `diffconfig` to generate the fragment

```shell

bitbake virtual/kernel -c diffconfig
```


11. Inspect the fragment and see what it does
12. **Optionally:**  Add the fragment to your kernel recipe. Similar to adding a patch!
