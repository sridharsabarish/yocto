# Exercise 12: BSP & Kernel Modifications!

## Learning Outcome

1. Explore the existing BSP layers in Yocto
2. Learn how to find more BSPs!
3. Learn how to modify the linux kernel 


## Updating a kernel. 

In this segment, we will modify the kernel using kernel fragments.

You can refer to the [kernel manual for help](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/kernel-dev/index.html) 

1. Run this command

```shell
bitbake virtual/kernel -c menuconfig
```

2.  Go to  `Networking Support`  and enable the `CAN bus subsystem support`
Feel free to enable more setting as you like.

Now go the exit option and keep exiting.
At the end it will ask you to save like the image below, choose the yes option

3. Exit the menu config

4. Run `diffconfig` to generate the fragment

```shell

bitbake virtual/kernel -c diffconfig
```

5. Inspect the fragment `.cfg` file and see how it looks like. (max 2mins)


Run 'savedefconfig`
```shell 

bitbake virtual/kernel -c savedefconfig

```



## Part 2  : Exploring existing BSP layers

6. Go to `/home/yocto/work/poky/poky/meta-yocto-bsp` and identify what machines available from this layer?
   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
  Look at the directory structure of `conf`.
</details>
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	   `beaglebone-yocto`, `genericarm64`. `genericx86-64` and `genericx86`
   </details>

7. Find the source for `qemux86-64`, this is not in this layer.

   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
   Are there only one bsp layers?
</details>
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	check `home/yocto/work/poky/poky/meta/conf/machine`
   </details>

## Part 3: Machines 

8. Identify how to build for beaglebone board?
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	 `MACHINE="beaglebone-yocto"`
   </details>

6. Refer the slides and also the location in hint and determine which of the following is not a variable relevant for bsp layers
-  `SERIAL_CONSOLES` , `KERNEL_IMAGETYPE` , `MACHINEOVERRIDES`, `TUNE_ARCH`, `MACHINE_FEATURES`, `MACHINE_INSTALLS`, `PREFERRED_PROVIDER`

  <details>
	   <summary>Hint</summary>
	When in doubt check!
	https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html
   </details>

  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	 `MACHINE_INSTALLS`
   </details>



##  Part 3 : Exploring External Layers

A **Board Support Package** (BSP) is a collection of information that defines how to support a particular hardware device, set of devices, or hardware platform. We can create a layer to keep recipes and other metadata related to this information. Usually this is done by the Vendor of a board and we can ususally find the Board support here https://layers.openembedded.org/

In the image below we see the source for these layers and it is just  a matter of cloning these layers and adding to our yocto build.

1. If i want to include support for `NVIDIA Tegra` processors which layer should i be downloading?

   <details>
   <summary>hint</summary>
   type nvidia tegra in the search with layers
</details>
  <details>
	   <summary>Answer</summary>
	`meta-tegra` is the needed layer! 
   </details>
